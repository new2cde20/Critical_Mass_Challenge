# Critical_Mass_Challenge
Repository for Critical Mass coding challenge.

Work / Project Examples:\
Three examples of work/projects that I've recently participated in are:
1) Software Engineering Capstone - This project was for my software engineering capstone at Lewis University. I collaborated with a classmate to redesign a website for a non-for-profit organization, the Cancer Support Center. During this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass Bourbon, and\
JQuery for the frontend design and applications on our website. For the backend actions of the website (i.e., allowing users to submit forms and emails on the website), I utilized PHP.\
Here is the link to the repository for this project: https://github.com/new2cde20/CSC_GroupRepo

2) CSmadeEasy - I collaborated with a classmate to create an app that adds people to a mailing list. I utilized HTML, CSS, Node.js, Bootstrap, and an API from MailChimp for this project. This repository is private due to keys/tokens we had to generate for the API but if you would like\
access to the repository, I can add you as a collaborator: https://github.com/henrypalmer/CSmadeEasy
Otherwise, I have included a copy of my code for this project in the email response for this challenge\
as a Google Drive link/attachment.

3) SerializeThis - This was a final project I completed in my object-oriented programming class. I utilized Java to create an application that serialized medical data for a patient/patients.\

Inspiration:
1) "Modern Website Design Trends with Examples and Tips for Designing a Website":\
https://fireart.studio/blog/modern-website-design-trends-with-examples-and-tips-for-designing-a-website/
I found this website's article inspiring while working on my Capstone project during my senior year of college.\
I thought it was inspiring because while redesigning the website for the Cancer Support Center (CSC),\
I wanted to focus on what my teammate and I could utilize to make our website look more modern compared\
to the original design that the CSC had for their website. I found this helpful to focus on what we\
could utilize with the knowledge, skills, and resources we had to design a website that looked appealing\
and often found that it was the simple things (e.g., lots of white space) that could contribute to a\
chic design.

2) "How to configure XAMPP to send mail from localhost?":\
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15965376/how-to-configure-xampp-to-send-mail-from-localhost/18185233#18185233
Next, I found this post on Stack Overflow inspiring while working on my Capstone project. I felt this way because
this project was the first time my teammate and I had ever used PHP and our own web server to send information over the Internet (in this case, sending emails and forms). It was challenging, but eventually I was able
to find this resource which allowed me to fix a few kinks in our PHP files/code and we were able to successfully\
submit information over our server without having to buy a domain.

3) "Reusable HTML Components â€“ How to Reuse a Header and Footer on a Website:"\
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reusable-html-components-how-to-reuse-a-header-and-footer-on-a-website/
Lastly, I found this website's article inspiring while working on my Capstone project. I thought it was\
inspiring because it allowed my teammate and I to design our website in a way that made coding easier for us -\ we didn't have to use as much code within our project. By using reusable HTML components,\
we could easily insert the header and footer on every HTML page we made without having to copy all of the code
from the header and footer on each subsequent HTML page.


-Focus: If I were given the time and resources to build/learn anything I wanted during my internship, I would\
like to have the opportunity to learn more popular frameworks and languages. My primary\
expertise in front-end programming is with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I find all of these great, I would\
like to be able to learn React and Vue.js. I've never built an app before - most of my\
projects have been web-focused (e.g., websites). If I could have the chance to build an app (or apps) using\
either React or Vue.js, I feel that it would be a wonderful opportunity for me to grow as a developer. If\
React and/or Vue.js are not options, I still would like to have the opportunity to build an app using whatever\
languages/frameworks/IDE(s) that Critical Mass focuses on using. So, if that means using something like Android Studio, I'd be open to that as well.


Code Challenge:\
Link to the work I completed for the CodeSandbox challenge: https://yhqo7.csb.app/

I was able to complete the following from this challenge:\
-Looping over menuItems and categorizing them into sections based on each item's 'type'.
-I was able to sort the items by their 'menuOrder' but was not able to do this by each category (e.g., I couldn't sort all the starters by menuOrder). I was able to sort all of the items by menuOrder (largest to smallest).
-I was able to render the sorted results into the appropriate container within 'index.html'
-I was able to add some "Italian menu" styling to boost my store's sales.

I was not able to complete the following/got stuck on the following:
-I was not able to format the prices.
-I was not able to render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where 'spicy' was true.

Even though I was not able to complete everything in this section, I had some ideas on where I wanted to go with the parts I wasn't able to complete, which you can see in my commented out code (index.js).

I was able to learn a lot while completing this portion of the coding challenge, particularly with JavaScript, and I appreciate the opportunity to participate in Critical Mass's coding challenge!
